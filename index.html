		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<p class=AboutMe><img id=pic src="assets/images/AboutMe.jpg" alt "My_Family_and_I" align:right>Hi, my name is Misael Rivera. I'm one of the rare locals that were actually born here in Orlando FLorida. Graphic design has been a hobby of mine since I first discovered MS Paint at the age of 10. Eventually, I started playing with PhotoShop and grew to love it. After high school, I chose to not pursue it as a career, but it remained a hobby. </p>

		<br>
	
		<p class=AboutMe>Currently, I am a project coordinator for a specialty pharmacy, managing the development and administration of 3 portals. In the 2 years i've been in this position, I've realized I should have followed my passion. I've learned a great deal in my journey so I have no regrets, but I am glad to be pursuing a career fueled by passion and fun. </p>
